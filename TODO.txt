- Make the algorithm scale better with the number of particles. Currently the
  runtime is O(N^2) with respect to the number of particles, due to the
  separation rule. Should be able to make this O(N*log(N)) by using suitable
  data structures & algorithms.

- Have the flock avoid arbitrary geo (including other particles) instead of
  just a single fixed point.
